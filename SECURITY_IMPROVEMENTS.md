# Security Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the security improvements implemented to prevent API abuse, negative like counts, and unauthorized access to sensitive endpoints.

## Authentication System

### Wallet-Based Authentication
The app uses Solana wallet-based authentication:
- Users connect their Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
- Wallet connection automatically triggers JWT token generation
- JWT tokens are used for API authentication
- Tokens expire after 24 hours

### Authentication Flow
1. User connects wallet via `WalletMultiButton`
2. Frontend automatically calls `/api/auth/login` with wallet address
3. Backend generates JWT token and stores user in database
4. Token is stored in localStorage with expiration
5. All authenticated API calls include the JWT token

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Negative Like Counts
**Problem**: Users were able to manipulate like counts to go negative by calling the API directly.

**Solution**:
- Added database constraints to prevent negative values
- Added application-level validation using `Math.max(0, count)`
- Created migration `003_add_likes_constraints.sql` to enforce constraints

### 2. API Authentication
**Problem**: APIs were accessible without proper authentication, allowing unauthorized access.

**Solution**:
- Implemented JWT-based authentication for sensitive endpoints
- Created `lib/auth-middleware.ts` for centralized authentication
- Added authentication requirements to like and comment APIs
- Auto-login system when wallet connects

### 3. Rate Limiting
**Problem**: No rate limiting existed, allowing users to spam APIs.

**Solution**:
- Implemented rate limiting for likes (5 per minute per user per game)
- Implemented rate limiting for views (10 per minute per IP per game)
- Implemented rate limiting for comments (3 per minute per user per game)

### 4. CSRF Protection
**Problem**: No CSRF protection existed, making the app vulnerable to cross-site request forgery.

**Solution**:
- Added origin and referer validation
- Implemented domain whitelist for production environments

### 5. Input Validation
**Problem**: Limited input validation allowed potential abuse.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive input validation for comments
- Implemented content length limits (max 1000 characters)
- Added wallet address validation

## Files Modified

### New Files Created
- `lib/auth-middleware.ts` - Authentication and security middleware
- `lib/auth-utils.ts` - Authentication utility functions
- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` - Login API endpoint
- `components/auth-status.tsx` - Authentication status component
- `migrations/003_add_likes_constraints.sql` - Database constraints
- `SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - This documentation

### Files Updated
- `app/api/games/[id]/like/route.ts` - Added authentication, rate limiting, CSRF protection
- `app/api/games/[id]/view/route.ts` - Added rate limiting and CSRF protection
- `app/api/games/[id]/comment/route.ts` - Added authentication, rate limiting, input validation
- `app/games/[id]/page.tsx` - Updated to handle auto-login and authentication
- `components/comments-section.tsx` - Updated to handle auto-login and authentication

## Database Changes

### Constraints Added
```sql
-- Prevent negative counts
ALTER TABLE projects ADD CONSTRAINT projects_likes_count_non_negative CHECK (likes_count >= 0);
ALTER TABLE projects ADD CONSTRAINT projects_views_count_non_negative CHECK (views_count >= 0);
ALTER TABLE projects ADD CONSTRAINT projects_comments_count_non_negative CHECK (comments_count >= 0);

-- Prevent duplicate likes
ALTER TABLE likes ADD CONSTRAINT likes_project_wallet_unique UNIQUE (project_id, wallet);
```

### Indexes Added
```sql
-- Performance improvements
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_likes_project_wallet ON likes(project_id, wallet);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_comments_project_created ON comments(project_id, created_at DESC);
```

## API Changes

### Authentication Required
- `POST /api/games/[id]/like` - Now requires JWT token
- `POST /api/games/[id]/comment` - Now requires JWT token

### New Authentication Endpoint
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Generates JWT token for wallet address

### Rate Limiting
- All endpoints now include rate limiting headers
- 429 status code returned when rate limit exceeded
- `retryAfter` field indicates when to retry

### Error Handling
- Improved error messages for better user experience
- Proper HTTP status codes for different error types
- Rate limit information in error responses

## Frontend Changes

### Authentication Flow
- Auto-login when wallet connects
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage with expiration
- Automatic token refresh handling
- Proper error handling for authentication failures

### User Experience
- Seamless wallet-based authentication
- Clear error messages for rate limiting
- Proper feedback for authentication requirements
- Graceful handling of expired tokens

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these environment variables are set:
```env
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Connect wallet - should automatically login
2. Try to like a game without wallet - should show auth error
3. Try to like a game multiple times quickly - should hit rate limit
4. Try to post a comment without wallet - should show auth error
5. Try to post a very long comment - should be rejected
6. Try to access APIs from unauthorized domains - should be blocked

### Database Testing
1. Run the migration to ensure constraints are applied
2. Verify that negative values are prevented
3. Check that duplicate likes are prevented

## Monitoring

### Logs to Monitor
- Authentication failures
- Rate limit violations
- CSRF protection blocks
- Database constraint violations
- Auto-login success/failure rates

### Metrics to Track
- API request rates per user/IP
- Authentication success/failure rates
- Error rates by endpoint
- Wallet connection rates

## Future Improvements

1. **Signature Verification**: Add proper wallet signature verification for enhanced security
2. **Redis-based Rate Limiting**: Move from in-memory to Redis for distributed rate limiting
3. **IP Geolocation**: Add location-based rate limiting
4. **User Reputation**: Implement reputation system for trusted users
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Track and analyze API usage patterns
6. **Webhook Notifications**: Alert on suspicious activity

## Deployment Notes

1. Run the database migration before deploying
2. Ensure JWT_SECRET is set in production
3. Update domain whitelist in CSRF protection if needed
4. Monitor logs for any issues after deployment
5. Consider gradual rollout to test the changes
6. Test wallet connection flow in production environment
